        <strong>The National Service Scheme</strong> is a program of voluntary public service initiated by the Government of India under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports in the year 1969. It focuses on the development of the personality and character of students through community service and encouraging social responsibility, leadership, and national integration. Schools, colleges, and universities open this service for students. This program inspires the youth to participate in various social activities, including cleanliness, literacy camps, environmental conservation, health camps, and relief operation campaigns in disaster-hit areas. Through these activities, volunteers acquire life skills, a sense of team practice, and sense of civic responsibility. The motto of NSS is "Not Me, But You." This slogan reflects the spirit of selfless service and empathy toward the society. Thus, NSS is more than just service to the nation, as through its participation students also contribute towards their personal development and become good citizens and the leaders of this nation.
